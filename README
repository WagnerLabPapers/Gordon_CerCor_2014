Here we have made available summarized behavioral and neural data from [Gordon, Rissman, Kiani and Wagner, Cerebral Cortex 2014], as well as scripts used in the analysis of these data. Scripts are provided so that readers can see how the data from this study were analyzed; they have not been edited for ease of general use.  

The Matlab scripts require the following dependencies:
1) spm5 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm)
2) liblinear toolbox (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear)
3) the princeton mvpa toolbox (http://www.pni.princeton.edu/mvpa)

The R scripts require the package lme4 (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/)
